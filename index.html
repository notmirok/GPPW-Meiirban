    <h1>Research: Lack of Computers in Schools and Organizations</h1>

    <p>
        This research was conducted through an anonymous survey with 50 respondents, including:
        72% students, 8% teachers, 2% school administrators, 6% civil servants, and 12% IT professionals and private entrepreneurs.
        The results show that the problem of insufficient computers in Kazakhstan affects many people, and solving this issue is critical for improving both the educational process and the operations of organizations.
    </p>

    <h3>Roles of Respondents</h3>
    <img src="chart1.png" alt="Roles of responders" width="600">
    <p>Figure 1 illustrates that most respondents are students (72%), which provides a perspective on the issue from the educational process.</p>

    <h3>Availability of Computers for Daily Needs</h3>
    <img src="chart2.png" alt="Sufficiency of computers" width="600">
    <p>Figure 2 shows that 24% of respondents believe they lack sufficient computers for daily tasks, while 76% say they have enough. This highlights that a quarter of people face issues due to computer shortages.</p>

    <h3>Number of People Sharing One Computer</h3>
    <img src="chart3.png" alt="Number of people using one computer" width="600">
    <p>Figure 3 demonstrates that 54% of respondents share one computer between several people, which significantly limits their work efficiency.</p>

    <h3>Frequency of Problems Accessing Computers</h3>
    <img src="chart4.png" alt="Frequency of problems accessing computers" width="600">
    <p>Figure 4 shows that for 8% of respondents, computer access is a frequent problem, which complicates their daily activities.</p>

    <h3>Discussion of Results</h3>
    <p>
        The survey results confirm the hypothesis that a lack of technology reduces students' digital literacy and limits their access to modern educational resources. This is particularly true for schools, where students often use their mobile phones instead of computers, which distracts them and reduces lesson effectiveness.
    </p>

    <h3>Recommendations for Solving the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Among the suggested solutions, 28% of respondents believe that funding should be increased to purchase computers for schools and organizations. Others suggested selling old computers or eradicating corruption in the procurement process, which would also have a significant impact on the situation.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        This research emphasizes the importance of addressing the lack of computers in Kazakhstan. To improve the situation, increased funding and the establishment of a reliable, low-cost computer supplier for educational institutions are essential. These measures will not only improve the quality of education but also boost digital literacy in the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        For further research, it is crucial to explore potential solutions to this issue in other regions of the country and conduct more detailed studies on how access to technology affects education quality in various sectors.
